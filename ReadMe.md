POE FINAL PART <br>


1. Changelog: <br>

- Based on the feedback received from part 2, I made more commits to GitHub (10+). <br>
- New Features added to the app (that were not in part 2) is: a seperate screen for add menu items, a seperate screen to filter menu items, the average price per course type displayed on the menu manager screen. <br>
- The homepage is the default page, so the user can choose to return to that page from the filter screen or add item screen. <br>
- The menu items are saved in an array. <br>
- I made slight changes to the styling, i used more pastel colours than darker colours to add a more homey feel to the app and so that all screens match. <br>
- I made the ui simple and similar to part 2. <br>
- I kept the Welcome screen and menu manager under app tsx because it worked better that way for me as i was met with countless errors when i had too many screens, i.e a screen for each part of the app like welcome, home, menu, add item, filter. <br>
- Since having made less commits in part 2 was my only downfall, i figured i was on the right track with what i currently have. <br>
